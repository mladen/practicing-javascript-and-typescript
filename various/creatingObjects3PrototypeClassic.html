  // In fact, this is such a common pattern that the language has built-in support for it.
  // We don’t need to create our own shared object (the prototype object).
  // Instead, a prototype object is created for us automatically alongside every function,
  // and we can put our shared data there:
  thing.prototype.f = function () {};
  thing.prototype.g = function () {};

  function thing() {
    var o = Object.create(thing.prototype); // Object.create creates a new Object with the prototype set to a certain object

    o.x = 42;
    o.y = 3.14;

    return o;
  }

  var o = thing();
  // But there’s a drawback. This is going to result in some repetition.
  // The first and last lines of the thing function are going to be repeated almost
  // verbatim in every such delegating-to-prototype factory function.

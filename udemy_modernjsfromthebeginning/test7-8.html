  // DATA TYPES

  /*
    We have two types of data types:
      1. Primitive data type
           Stored directly in the location the variable accesses
           Stored on the stack
           So when we access primitive data we access it by it's actual value

           String
           Number (decimals, integers, floats - they are all of a Number type)
           Boolean
           Null
           Undefined
           Symbols (ES6)
      2. Reference data type (they are considered objects)
         - (are objects that are) accessed by reference - which means that the data
           isn't actually stored in the variable.
           These objects are actually stored on the heap (which has to do with
           dynamically allocated memory)

           Arrays
           Object Literals
           Functions
           Dates
           Anything else we can store?
           (We also have object wrappers for strings and numbers)

    Type conversion

  let val // We cannot do something like this using const (const must have a value)
  val = 35

  console.log(val)
  console.log(typeof val)
  console.log(val.length) // "undefined" because "length" is a function of a string, and currently "val" is a Number
  console.log('---')

  // Number to string
  val = String(35)

  console.log(val)
  console.log(typeof val)
  console.log(val.length) // Now "val" contains a String (we've converted the Number 5 into a String)
  console.log('---')

  // Expression to a string
  val = String(5+7) // The first thing that's gonna happen is that the expression is going to be evaluated
                    // and only than the conversion (to a String) of that result will happen

  console.log(val)
  console.log(typeof val)
  console.log(val.length) // Now "val" contains a String (we've converted the Number 5 into a String)
  console.log('---')

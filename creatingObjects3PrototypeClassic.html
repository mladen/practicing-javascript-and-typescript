  // In fact, this is such a common pattern that the language has built-in support for it.
  // We donâ€™t need to create our own shared object (the prototype object).
  // Instead, a prototype object is created for us automatically alongside every function,
  // and we can put our shared data there:
  thing.prototype.f = function () {};
  thing.prototype.g = function () {};

  function thing() {
    var o = Object.create(thing.prototype);

    o.x = 42;
    o.y = 3.14;

    return o;
  }

  var o = thing();
